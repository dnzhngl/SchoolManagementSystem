# SchoolManagementSystem
This is the first major project that I have developed. It is the final project for the .NET course graduation.

The project is a school management system that has 4 different types of users. 
- Admin panel, that allows school principle (admin) to make all kinds of arrangements that he should make. 
  Admin can perform CRUD operations on classroms, grades, sections,  subjects, exams, lecturers, lecturers' branches, students and the parents, events and annoucements.
  When admin adds an user into the system their account created automatically.
- Teachers can use the system to check their lesson schedule and can see their students and the academic informations of them. Also, they can perform CRUD operations on exam results of their students.
- Students can see their school related informations annocuments, timetables, exam dates and results.
- Parents can track their children's situation at the school as well.
- All the users can send messages each others.

There are parts that I need to make improvements on the project, and I will make improvements when I have free time. 
Please consider my hard work on this project and if you want to use it please inform me. 
Thank you for your consideration.
